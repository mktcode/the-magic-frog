<story-part-legacy username="mkt">there was a wizard,...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="atra-aranea">who wanted to travel the wide world to make new contacts and gather knowledge. Soon he had visited many places, in each of which he was warmly welcomed. However, he was often warned about his next destination: he should be careful...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="holger.random">The way is dangerous and the destination not worth the journey. Until this moment, however, the warning was always unfounded.</story-part-legacy>

# Chapter 1: Irritation in the Wilderness

</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="holger.random">The wizard was walking along a forest path whistling loudly when he heard a strange noise....</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="mkt">A rhythmic clapping, like when you slap two well-seasoned sides of beef against each other, over and over again. And a rather agonised grumbling and groaning. When he tried to catch a glimpse of what was happening through the undergrowth...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">What he saw took his breath away. There in the clearing, a figure the size of a hippopotamus, with the skin of a toad and the face of a donkey was about to perform what resembled a ritual courtship. But for whom? Then he noticed...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="atra-aranea">a breath at his back. Slowly he turned around and caught sight of the second creature directly behind him. It was also quite large and resembled a cat - but with feathers and several tails. Suddenly a tail shot towards him....</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="rapier-e01">"Whoa" he jumped to the side. A spike on its tail hit his coat and nailed him to the nearest tree. His staff flew away and disappeared into the undergrowth. He wriggled anxiously as the creature sniffed at him and cooed contentedly....</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">...the foul body odour of the creature made him faint shortly afterwards. As he lay on his stomach, slowly regaining his senses, his gaze still glassy, he realised that he was bound by his arms and legs. A cold breeze went...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">over his naked back and his hair stood up. On the floor in front of him, in a kind of nest, the creature sat and was absorbed in its personal hygiene. Feathers and that smell were buzzing everywhere in the air. The creature paused and...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="atra-aranea">looked at him joyfully and expectantly. He had no idea how he should react - he certainly did not want to feel the wrath of the creature. He decided to lower his head and wait, after all he was still tied up.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="rapier-e01">He felt the creature coming closer and its breath brushed against his head. There was a crashing and cracking sound in the undergrowth and the creature jerked its head up. Snarling, it looked into the forest. A familiar snort and clap made the mage flinch.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant" image="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6792578/125064565-10c34d00-e0b1-11eb-8dbc-7779b9426221.png"></story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="atra-aranea">Both beings hissed at each other. Neither of them noticed the snake-like creature in the background. Strangely, it seemed to have human features. When both looked up from their argument, the wizard had disappeared from the nest.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="atra-aranea">The cat-like creature was anything but pleased about this. It pulled its claws through its admirer's face and sprinted into the forest. Meanwhile, the wizard regained consciousness in an unfamiliar place. Cautiously, he looked around.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">A glaring light and cold surrounded him, but it smelled very pleasant in this place. Blinded by the light, he carefully felt around him. Then he felt something pleasantly warm in his hand. Slowly his fingers moved higher, the warmth flowed through him....</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="atra-aranea">But soon the warmth became unpleasantly hot. But he did not want to let go of what he had just felt, because he did not want to feel that cold again. Instead, he tried to open his eyes, hoping not to be blinded again.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="rapier-e01">An angry woman's voice reached his ear. "Let go of me you..." as his eyes adjusted to the light, he saw a small fairy whose petite body tried to free itself from his grip while she scolded him loudly.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">Now he was completely confused. Instantly he let go of the fairy. "So this is the thanks I get for freeing you from the clutches of those two mating madmen!!!? You want to crush me?" A feeling of shame flowed through him.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="atra-aranea">"I'm... I'm sorry." he stammered sheepishly. "I didn't know there was a snake and then cold and so bright." "Now you explain to me first how you got the insane idea to cross this forest. Then I'll decide what to do next."</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="atra-aranea">"After all, you owe me for saving you." the angry fairy explained. The wizard collected himself for a moment before explaining to the fairy how he had ended up in the forest: "I lost my staff in the process. I have to find it again."</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">"Don't worry, my little wizard." the fairy replied and rummaged in her little bag. After she had brought all kinds of sticks and stick-like objects out of her bag, she paused for a moment and bang, there it was, his beloved staff.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="rapier-e01">There it was, the wand he thought he had lost, in all its glory. The black wood polished and the green crystal on the tip sparkled brilliantly in the sunlight. Only there was one small problem. It was no bigger than a chopstick.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="atra-aranea">"It's, um, kind of too small?" the wizard asked cautiously. "You stupid human. Take it and it'll be your size." the fairy explained annoyed. He then learned that he was to accompany the fairy to a certain town as a thank you for saving him.</story-part-legacy>

# Chapter 2: The Smell of Trouble

</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="atra-aranea">She had some important business to do there, but fairies were not very highly regarded there. Without a human companion, it was impossible for her to even pass through the city gates.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">The magician had been waiting for such an opportunity for a long time. At last he could prove to the world what his staff and he were made of. So the unequal pair set off for the city. Once there...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="the5kyliner">it didn't take long for a grumpy guard to block their way. "No entry for fairy creatures, little doll!" he immediately rumbled. The courage the wizard had mustered earlier had already evaporated. "Ex... Excuse me, sir...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="the5kyliner">We... We'd like to pass." the wizard stammered, leaving the guard unimpressed. "We have no room for fools like you here either. Get lost!" The little fairy sighed in annoyance, opened her bag and immediately pulled out a...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">a fist-sized lump of gold. Immediately the guard's expression changed, drool ran down his chin. After the fairy had handed him the lump, he made a dissolute movement and let the mismatched pair pass.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="atra-aranea">The fairy then immediately began to guide the wizard through the alleys until she told him to stop, in front of an ingredient shop for potions. "In here. But this time don't stammer around. We don't want to get kicked out again, do we?"</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">The wizard took a deep breath and immediately pushed open the door to the ingredients shop. And that's when it happened. The door's impact hit the city governor's daughter, who was known for her big nose, right on her fat beak.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="rapier-e01">She nagged and immediately shouted "you stupid incompetent, rotten..." she snapped. The wizard rebounded and stumbled backwards. His wand touched her robe as he tipped backwards and soft light danced around her and enveloped her...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="atra-aranea">to then turn into smoke. When it subsided, they both stared at the daughter. But they could not see any change. The fairy hissed softly in his ear: "What have you done now? Not nothing at all, for sure!"</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">And it was not nothing that happened... Just at that moment, the daughter of the city ruler grabbed the wizard and pressed him tightly against her, "Hello, handsome! You're going to be my new toy. My man!" He looked around helplessly at the fairy.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="rapier-e01">The fairy put her hand over her mouth so as not to let out a loud roar. That would be interesting. She decided to stay in the background for the time being and watched from a corner as the sturdy lady dragged the helplessly kicking wizard out of the shop.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="atra-aranea">Asked what she wanted here, the fairy named the ingredients she needed. "Huh, will it be a little love potion?" came from the shop assistant. "But I'm not allowed to sell you anything without a human companion.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="mkt">"A love potion? I don't need that." replied the fairy, looking anxiously at the door. "Don't you know who this mage is? The Stadtholder's daughter is in danger! So please pack the ingredients and then let's get going!</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">"No arguments, miss," the salesman replied. "The only one in danger here is your friend, the magician. Don't you know what happened to the other gentlemen who fell into the clutches of the governor's daughter?"</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="atra-aranea">"Um... To be honest, no." the fairy replied a little meekly for the first time. She had imagined her city trip to be quite different, much less complicated. Just to get some ingredients and what did it turn into? A mage rescue mission.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="rapier-e01">"Be right back." She floated out the door with fluttering wings. "But lady you mustn't..." the slamming of the door cut off the shop assistant's words. A dirty alley lay before her at the end of which the path forked. Where was he?</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="science.fiction">Meanwhile, the magician was desperately trying to remember a spell he had once successfully used countless years ago to free a friend from a similar situation.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="atra-aranea">A bright glow and loud screams made the fairy choose the left alley. Obviously right. Brightly glowing arrows floated in the air and pointed to a red heart. The mage then approached her: "The woman is gone, all is well!"</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="the-fly-swarm">Behind him, the creature from the clearing slowly approached. The creature began to whimper and ducked.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="rapier-e01">She looked at the creature and said: "Holy shit what are you doing here?" The creature spotted her, jumped up and ran towards the fairy, howling happily and snorting, knocking over several carts and residents and adding to the general chaos.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="mkt">"Come on, wizard. I've got what I need! Let's get out of here!" Clasped tightly by the claws of the toad-hippopotamus, that could also fly, they escaped the mess they had made. "Tell me, what is your name?" asked the fairy.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">"Gilbert of Esteragon the Fourth. My great-great-grandfather was once the most powerful..." "Yeah yeah, all right." the fairy interrupted him. "So Gilbert, listen up. Here's what's going to happen now..."</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="mkt">"The three of us will now return to my cave, as planned, and then, also as planned, I will finally brew my potion." the fairy explained in a calm tone "Hooey, booze, it's going to be a feast!" cried the moronic toad-hippo.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">Finally arrived in the cave, the fairy immediately started to prepare the potion. While the toad-hippopotamus again produced the rhythmic clapping, reminiscent of two hung cattle halves slapping against each other, through its dance...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="mkt">the cat creature, who was also back, stared at the wizard with the same joyful look he already knew from the encounter in the forest. "Gilbert, relax. You're going to like it. Trust me." the fairy spoke with an excited look.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">The events of that night have only been passed down in the form of rumours, and the wild shrieks and devastation remain eternally without explanation. None of those responsible was ever seen again, alive or dead.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="mkt">The End!</story-part-legacy>
