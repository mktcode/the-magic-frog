<story-part-legacy username="mkt">there was a wizard...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="localnorth">who had to run some errands to plan a surprise party for his little frog friend.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">what caught the attention of the high council of suspicious and insatiable storks in the neighborhood</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="imbigdee">They all planned to stop the party because of what the oracle revealed to them about the main surprise at the party.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="imwatsi">But they all had to be very careful... The wizard was known to respond very badly to people who meddled in his affairs!</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">Because the storks were wise, they let the confused oracle talk and were happy about the invitation to the party the pigeon delivered at that moment.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="mkt">But a certain thing about this invitation made the storks still skeptical. The invitation was...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="buttpacker">...asking that all attendees show up in their birthday suits - but it wasn't like any of the other animals wore clothes anyway!</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">Since the magician was known for his crude humor and his preference for nudism, the skepticism turned into pure joy at upcoming feasts.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="beyonddisability">To make it even more joyful, the wizard planned to give a prize for the best birthday suit ever. All the creatures in forest decided to join the party. Even the snakes but with a dark plan in their minds.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="enforcer48">"Wait!" said one stork, "do we really want to see the wizard naked?" The imagery started to flow through their minds, but they figured that they would be fine.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="amosbastian">With some hesitation the storks eventually arrived at the party. The festivities they encountered there appeared to be beyond their wildest dreams! "Oh my! I've never seen anything like this before!" exclaimed the wisest stork of the bunch.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="vegaron">Inside the wizard's lair there stands the wizard clothe just like the day he was born! Totally destroying the beauty of the decorations...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="chrislyr">The animals have never seen such a sight before. They even wished they can unsee what they've just saw.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="helo">So that they could see it again as if for the first time. Disco lights everywhere, blaring music and wonderful costumes, all birthday related of course. The party went on until...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="mcyusuf">The door opened, everyone looked in the direction and behold! The little frog appeared from the inner chambers of the castle, looked at the guests present, cleared his throat and said ...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="tdre">"I regret to announce that this is the END. I am going. I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE! Nah, just croakin' with you. Pass the fly mix."</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="chadrona">After saying that he tells everyone to keep partying. While most are enjoying the party, some shady business are happening in the shadows...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="riovanes">In a remote part of the castle, some figures are seen talking. A closer look reveal a group of snakes! "Hisss! Is everything prepared?" Asked a big snake. "Hisss! Yes!" Answered another. "Hisss! Good, begin the plan!" The big snake ordered.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="chrislyr">Slithering, the snakes move with stealth, trying not to get anyone's attention - especially the wizard's. Surprisingly, their destination is none other than the wizard's laboratory!</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="amosbastian">Once inside the laboratory they had to move with haste! "Hisss! Get the ingredientsss and ssstart brewing the potion" ordered the big snake. The small snakes quickly slithered to the cauldron and started working...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="chrislyr">"Hisss! Is it not done yet?" The leader asked nervously. They must hurry before the wizard notices anything amiss! "Hiss! Almost!" Replied a snake. But before the captain can reply, he heard foot steps!</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="buttpacker">The stealthy snakes quickly hid, as an extremely shitfaced wizard stumbled into the room and started mumbling to himself as he rummaged through his shelf of concoctions. Suddenly he took a step back, and started throwing up into the cauldron.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="tdre">Sparks flew from the cauldron as the wizard's magical vomit sent the snakes brew awry. Slowly the shape of a creature began to form from the frothy mess.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="riovanes">The creature roar menacingly, but upon seeing the wizard it was so frightened it shriek like a girl! Then with unbelievable speed it dash out the room. Both the wizard and the hiding snakes were dumbfounded...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="vegaron">"Goodness gracious! What a strange creature." The wizard thought out loud. "I must capture it and make it the subject of my next experiment!" Said the wizard, excitement gleaming in his eyes.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="tdre">"Quickly," the wizard commanded the snakes matter-of-factly, "after him...her...it!" The snakes were flabbergasted at the wizard's gall to give orders. "Now, sssee here," a snake began. But the wizard had already dashed off after the beast.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant" image="https://i.imgur.com/uJaJeTn.png"></story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="riovanes">Being pursued by the wizard the fly demon went on a rampage and destroyed everything in its path. Then it stumbled upon the little frog who was still partying. At the sight of the fly demon its eyes glitters with excitement! "Croak! So much flies!"</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="enforcer48">The little frog opened its mouth and it became many times that of its body! The Wizard yelled, "Wait!!" But, it was too late. The frog had swallowed the demon whole! The guests were all frozen in awe at the feat.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="riovanes">The wizard was disappointed after the little frog swallowed the fly demon, but then he remembered that he can just make another one with the help of the snakes. "You guys can continue with the party." The wizard said, then looked at the snakes...</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="enforcer48">The snakes had nervous looks in their eyes. The storks, still frozen in fear, decided that they should probably abort their plans about ruining the party.</story-part-legacy>

<story-part-legacy username="hennifant">But then the bored, fat rhino in the corner began to fall asleep. It stumbled and tumbled until it could not stay on it's feet anymore and fell, totally squishing the wizard beneath it. He was dead immediately.</story-part-legacy>
